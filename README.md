This is a Simple A* search Algorithm simulation using python . A* search is an informed search algorithm that uses heuristics to guide the search efficiently.
The A* (A-star) search algorithm is one of the most popular and effective search algorithms used in computer science for finding the shortest path between two points. It combines the strengths of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search, making it both complete and optimal under specific conditions. A* is widely employed in various applications such as robotics, computer games, and route-finding applications.
